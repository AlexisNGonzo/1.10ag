	<h1><strong>Introduction to me</strong></h1>
		<h2><b>My likes</b></h2>
		<p> I think I can consider myself an artistic person. I like testing art media and different styles, to show this I have included a two digital media piece I have completed.</p>

		<p><i>A Monarch Fairy.</i> </p>
		<p>This piece is a little old but definitly one I am proud of due to the colors and the basket I drew!</p>
		<p><b>I also love testing styles and techniques.</b> </p>

	  <p><i>Sharp Color Warp</i></p>
		<p>This was me testing the color and form of my outlines. I was getting bored of my normal straight and uniform lines. So I spiced it up, I limited my curved lines and nixed the color black. I really like it but only use this style when I wanted to make my art funky.</p>
